The work was carried out exactly as described, in a very professional, clean, and commendable fashion.

We had had soakaway issues since we moved in to the property 2 years ago. We had had several failed attempts with other companies, but as soon as EVO arrived on site and did their assessment I knew we were in safe hands. The job was not easy because of the garden layout, but EVO managed to replace the soakaway and carry out a full reinstatement, that, within 2 weeks of completion, you wouldn't have known any work had been done.
