	boiler and heating system with EVO Plumbing and Heating Services. Not only will power flushing

	metals. Power flushing is a simple and effective way to remove this sludge, along with the build-up
	of rust, scale and debris, and ensure the even distribution of heat throughout your entire system.

<h3 class="h4 coloured-text">What is power flushing?</h3>
<p>
	Power flushing is the specialist process of forcibly cleansing a heating system with water. Whilst
	it sounds quite simple, the water must be applied at high-velocity and low-pressure so that no
	physical damage is caused to the system. The purpose of power flushing is to restore systems to
	optimum operation; improving overall circulation and resolving boiler noise issues.
