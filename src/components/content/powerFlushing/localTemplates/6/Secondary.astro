		Signs of your central heating system going out of kilter become quite obvious. Here are a few
		that you should look for and call us immediately when you spot them:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Slow warming of the system</li>
		<li>Partial heating of the radiator</li>
		<li>Cold spots present throughout the system</li>
		<li>Noise coming from the boiler</li>
		<li>The increasing frequency of bleeding required for radiators</li>
		<li>Increasing utility bills</li>
		<li>Valve or pump seizes to work</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Whenever you see any of the above signs, there's a chance that there is a buildup of debris and
		sludge in your central heating system, which is why it is malfunctioning.
	</p>
	<p>
		We recommend that you power flush your heating system every five years. It will maintain the
		performance of the system's boiler, radiators and pipes at optimal levels. You should also
		remember to conduct power flushing before installing a new boiler.
