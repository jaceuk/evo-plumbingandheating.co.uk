	<p>
		Sludge and debris build up adversely affects the efficiency of heating systems. It is
		recommended that you power flush your radiators, pipes and boiler at least every five years.
		However, it is possible that contaminants may act disruptively earlier. Watch out for these
		warning signs and book a power flush with us at the earliest:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Noticed that heat is not reaching all areas of your home?</li>
		<li>Is your heating system producing little or no hot water?</li>
		<li>Is your radiator cold at the bottom?</li>
		<li>Does it take a long time for your heating system to warm up?</li>
		<li>Observed discoloured water when you bleed your radiators?</li>
		<li>Does your boiler make funny noises all the time?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you have answered yes to even one of these questions, there is a good chance that your
		heating system requires a power flush.

	<p>
		Including power flushing in your home maintenance plan has important benefits that are hard to
		ignore. From a monetary perspective, a power flush can keep your heating system operating
		efficiently at all times and reduce your fuel bill. It also minimizes the risk of your boiler,
		radiator and pipes breaking down from sludge accumulation.
	</p>
	<p>
		An optimally functioning heating system also ensures good heat distribution and keeps your home
		comfortable, particularly avoiding inconvenience during cold weather.
