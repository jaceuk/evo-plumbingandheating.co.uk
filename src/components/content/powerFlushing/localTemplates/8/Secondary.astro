	<p>
		Periodic power flushing preserves the efficiency of your heating system, keeping every room in
		your home comfortable and your fuel bills low. You can also keep corrosion at bay and extend the
		life of the system.
	</p>
	<p>
		A faulty heating system can be a big bother during the cold months. Moisture condensing in
		winter can increase dampness and mould formation, triggering episodes in allergic or asthmatic
		family members. An uncomfortably cold indoor environment can also affect heart rate and blood
		pressure.

	<p>If you haven't scheduled a power flush in a long time, get it done today.</p>
