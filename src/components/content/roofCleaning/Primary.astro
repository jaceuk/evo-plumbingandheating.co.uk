<h2>Transform the look of your property by cleaning your roof</h2>
<p>
	At EVO Plumbing and Heating Services we specialise in cleaning unsightly moss and algae from roofs
	of all property types. Roof tiles become more porous with age. This, combined with our damp
	British climate, means that your roof is the perfect breeding ground for moss, algae and lichen.
	Over time, moisture can penetrate the tiles and left untreated, cause extensive, expensive damage.
