The temperatures are up and we are all outside enjoying the good weather, making the most of the outdoors.

Be it enjoying the sunshine whilst the kids play, setting your home office up on the garden table or using your outside space for continental-style eating and entertaining, a patio not only enhances the value of your property but also offers additional living space on these sunny days.

Over time these paved areas can start to look old and dull, with stains from spilt drinks, grease from the bbq or rust marks left by patio furniture or flower pots. The appeal of spending time out there starts to diminish.

A build-up of general dirt and grime naturally happens to hard outdoor surfaces no matter how careful you are, and depending on the position of your patio it can begin to be taken over by slippery algae, moss, lichens or weeds.

Patio cleaning and maintenance is one of those jobs that really need to be done annually. But it's a messy task that can so easily be put off by our busy lifestyles and the labour intensity of the task.

## Which way is best for you?

So the trick is finding the cleanest and easiest solution for getting this job marked off your to-do list. So which way is best for you?
Every household's priority is different. Whether you are trying to keep the costs down, want the task done quickly or put a higher concern about the impact harsh cleaners can have on the environment and the wildlife your garden hosts, we have hopefully covered all of these options below.

### The cheapest option

PH-neutral soap and a hand brush. Now if you are only needing to clean the front step, then this method is perfectly acceptable. But the idea of cleaning a 4m2 patio on your hands and knees is not something to be relished. But there are ways to adapt this method for the larger scale areas.
First start with removing all furniture, pots and any moss or debris. A stiff broom and a bucket of soapy suds is a solution for larger areas and an excellent choice for those with teenagers looking to build up their abs, but whilst this method is most budget-friendly, relies on hard work and elbow grease.

### The most ecologically friendly method

Using Grandma's old tried and tested cleaning tips and tricks of basic household ingredients. Again once the patio is clear of obstacles and debris, the first step is to rinse the whole patio with a 1:1 ratio of water and white vinegar. But be prepared for the cravings for a fish and chip supper with this step. Once this has been done a solution of 1-5 tablespoons of bicarbonate of soda to each 10 litres of water should be allowed to soak into the stones. Use the higher ratio of bicarb for those more discoloured and stubborn areas.
Once this has been left for 15-20 minutes work over the patio with a stiff brush then rinse with clean water.

### The best cost-effective method

This by far is the use of a pressure washer, but the use of these gadgets, whilst incredibly satisfying and also be incredibly messy. The splashback goes everywhere. Additionally, different surfaces such as sandstone and slate can become damaged with normal jet washing. This is because the layers making up the unique textures of this style of stone can be dislodged and split from the pressure of the water stream. In these circumstances, a lower pressure will need to be applied to the surface.

Another risk is damage to the mortar and grout that can easily be dislodged encouraging places for new weeds to take root. Deep roots, when left, can cause long-term damage to the foundations of your patio. Specialist attachments and brushes can be used to minimise damage.

### The quickest/least-effort solution

There are a number of different cleaning products on the market that can help reduce the labour and hard work of cleaning hard garden surfaces. But do beware that not all of these products are safe to use with pets or if your patio butts up against flower beds, lawned areas or ponds.

The best pet-friendly product currently on the market is Defenders STV940 Concentrated Path and Patio Cleaner.
This product is specifically formulated for use in areas used by children and pets, including birds and wildlife due to its Biodegradable formulation.

The best product for minimum effort is the Jarder Spray & Leave treatment. This product contains no acids or bleaching agents so once dry is safe to use around areas for pets and children.

Once diluted the product is washed over the patio and left of a period of 2-3 days for the effects to take place. This cleaner also continues to keep any build-up of mosses or algae away for up to 6 months.

The best heavy-duty cleaner recommended is JCB Heavy Duty Path & Patio Cleaner Concentrate.

This product is great for areas that have not been maintained for long periods of time. It specialises in the removal of lichens, moss and mould. Due to the caustic nature of this product, it is advised that pets are kept away from all areas until completely dry. You should avoid use near ponds and areas of wildlife, and any tools used, splashes and spills should be cleaned thoroughly with cold clean water.

As with all products it is always advised to test a small area to ensure that it is suitable for the materials that are used to make up your patio.
