Is your shower not draining properly?

Is the kitchen sink clogged again?

There is nothing worse than the moment you realise your drains are blocked. You’ve removed the plug in the bath and the water is just not going down.

The thought of the black and grey sludge that will be bought you if you try to plunge. And please please don't let it affect the toilet too.

The cause of blocked drains can happen for a number of reasons:

## Flooding

Flash flooding can cause the mains drainage system to fill with water rising human waste and matter into the pipes within your property. If this is a regular occurrence we would advise you to contact your council to ask them to investigate, providing them with dates and images of any damage or flooding.

## Hair

Long hair washes down the plug when bathing or showering. This hair will become matted with soap residue and quickly build up causing blockages. Using a drain strainer when you release the plug will catch hair and prevent clogs and build-up.

## Food and grease

Grease and food being poured into the drains is a definite no-no. Where possible food debris should be scrapped into the household waste and fats and oils stored in containers once cool for alternate methods of disposal.

When poured into drains, the fats and oils solidify as they cool preventing small food particles from washing away.

Even when using hot soapy water the fats will still accumulate in the pipes and U-bends, cooling and causing them to settle, over time the debris will build up like clogged arteries and reduce the water flow until it causes problems.

## Minerals in the water or pipes.

Old iron pipes can corrode and flakes can build up in the system.
Additionally, if you live in a hard water area limescale and minerals can build up in the drainage pipes just like they do on your shower head. Over time this build-up will restrict water flow.
This could also cause problems with your heating system if the water is not correctly treated.

## Foreign objects

It's like a slow-motion movie, you’re washing your hands and a priceless diamond ring slips off your finger. Or your beloved toddler was playing with their toys in the sink and a part has broken off and slipped down the drain.
These foreign bodies usually get stuck in the U-bend. And over time debris and scum will build up around this preventing a fast-flowing stream.

## Low water pressure

If these become a persistent problem it could be due to poor water pressure not pushing through the pipes and washing away the build-up of soap and toothpaste. Click-clack-style push plugs break the flow of the water pressure and can prohibit the water from flushing through efficiently. It could also be a result of the pipes being incorrectly fitted in the first place.

External drainage pipes have to be at a sharp enough angle to encourage the water to drain. If not, water sits stagnant causing regular blockages and issues affecting both the shower/ bath and sink.

## Blocked toilets

Blocked toilets can happen due to a number of reasons.

Low-flow toilets have been installed in houses for a number of years. Whilst these are great for helping the environment and reducing water bills, they are not so great at pushing through large volumes of toilet paper.

An ineffective flush valve seal will also reduce the volume of water being pushed through the pipes. To check this, remove the top of your cistern. As you depress the flush, a valve at the bottom of the cistern should lift allowing the water to pass through. If this doesn't open fully it will prevent the correct volume of water from passing through at the pressure required to push through the pipes.

## Foreign objects or large volumes being flushed away.

Toilets were designed to flush away human waste and small amounts of toilet paper.
Large amounts of toilet paper can clog the drains. Items such as sanitary towels, wet wipes, and condoms are not designed to be flushed as they will not break down in the drainage system and should be wrapped and placed in sanitary bins.

## Cesspits

If you have a cesspit at your premises, we would also advise that tampons be disposed of in a bin, and quilted/ multiply papers may also cause issues within your system.

Additionally, harsh chemicals and cleaning problems can destroy the enzymes that your system needs to break down the bulk waste. Always check the products you use around your home and suitable to be used with this kind of drainage system.
