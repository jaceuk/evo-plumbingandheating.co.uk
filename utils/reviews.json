Despite being Sunday, Steve Morgan agreed to visit later that day, after he had dealt with some other work already in hand. He arrived around 5 pm, as agreed and checked the various components of the boiler and central heating system. Almost immediately he decided that the problem was not sludge and examined various components, identifying the pump as the likely cause. By then, the previously agreed time and quoted cost had been reached, but Steve was determined to carry on and dismantle the pump, to confirm his diagnosis and attempt to restore the boiler to working condition. Having dismantled the pump, he did find that it was seized and managed to free it by lubricating the spindle. Having reinstalled the pump and restarted the boiler, all went well and the system is still running smoothly the following day. In identifying and rectifying the fault, Steve spent approximately twice the time originally allocated, without any additional charge. \"Above and beyond\" indeed. Thorough Steve remained professional and cheerful and was obviously determined to do his best rectify the problem and leave us with a fully functioning boiler and system.

He had to put extra effort than it was initially anticipated. We will be giving him a call to change our 20yr old boiler as soon as the winter finishes.
